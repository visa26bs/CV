  <li> Thanks. But I worked my way through this. You better acknowledge. I studied hard for my Master's degree entrance. I studied passionately during My masters degree. I fulfilled my ambition pretty early in life. How early you ask? By age 25. And suddenly I dint know what better to do. Then Covid happened and world came down on me.
     So now I have changed my goal post to becoming RICH.
     I feel this will be a more satisfying life story than me working for a cause.
     I tend to think of the big picture always. But now, I am sitting with myself to understand how do I want my future to be.
     You see, I have always worked for Governments and I got burned out in my last stint. I worked at the Covid Warroom and attended SOS calls, you can imagine.
     So I am currently just exploring careers, seeing how to make money smartly.</li>
