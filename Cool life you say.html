  <h1> Cool life you say ? </h1>

   Thanks.
    <br />
    <ul>
    <li> But I worked my way through this. You better acknowledge.</li>
    <li>I studied hard for my Master's degree entrance and cleared the TISS entrance by myself.</li>
    <li>I studied passionately during My Masters degree.</li>
    <li> I applied for jobs and fetched my job, had no placement.</li>
    <li> I fulfilled my ambition pretty early in life.</li>
<br />
    <strong> How early you ask?
<br />
    By age 25.</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    <li>And suddenly I dint know what better to do. I was happy with my role and dint have any idea of switching organization. Then Covid happened and world came down on me.</li>
     <li>So now I have changed my goal post to becoming RICH.</li>
     <li>I feel this will be a more satisfying life story than me working for a cause. </li>
     <li>I tend to think of the big picture always. But now, I am sitting with myself to understand how do I want my future to be.</li>
     <li>You see, I have always worked for Governments and I got burned out in my last stint with State Government. I worked at the Covid Warroom and attended SoS calls, So you can imagine. </li>
     <li> I am currently just exploring careers, seeing how to make money smartly.</li>
  </ul>
