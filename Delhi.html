  <h1> Away from Home, Part 2, Delhi </h1>

  <ul>
    <li> Delhi is a beautiful, well planned city as it rightly should be</li>
    <li> I witnessed Independence day at the Rajpath </li>
    <li> I was living in a working women's hostel which means living with people from all parts of the country.</li>
    <li> At the hostel we celebrated north indian festivals, introduced them to south indian festivals. We also celebrated our festivals, their way</li>
    <li> As happens with every other South Indian, I was also annoyed at their sheer ignorance of South India </li>
    <li> I thought I will be acing my job since I knew Hindi. But everyone around me was speaking in different variants of Hindi. I can offcourse understand what they are saying but I could'nt hold an entire conversation in Hindi. Neither could I answer as fast as I would like to, in Hindi. I also realised how I was coming up with a lot of literal translations in my head while I speak. </li>
    <li> I knew only some of the north indian dishes. When I had lunch with my colleagues, I discovered so many more dishes and also the hindi names of common vegetables. </li>
    <li> My lunch was mostly chapathi and some side dish (hostel food). I am not used to eating chapathi with spoon, unlike North Indians. Now I am regarded as a Southie who eats with their hands. In Ariyalur, I was the culture ridden girl eating with spoon. Matlab, Hadh hai! </li>
    <li> People would never know my caste, unless I told it; Since I dont have a Surname. But even though they had a surname I dint have knowledge of the caste names in North India. haha. Happily unaware. But I understood, it was very much part of social interactions. </li>
    <li> I loved exploring the city all by myself </li>
    <li> I loved winter shopping with my friends, from the famous shopping streets of Delhi. </li>
    <li> I loved Dilli HAAT </li>
    <li> I loved the spirit of Ministry meetings - the people, their dress, the language, it was beautiful.</li>
    <li> I would feel very happy to find Tamil speaking folks, once in a while. I became a regular at the TAMIL SANGAM festivities. It helped to have contacts from the Sangam during Pandemic </li>
    <li> There were often EXHIBITION conducted with display of items from all over the country. Exhibits included books, food, textiles etc</li>
    <li> There were also exhibition of products from other countries </li>
    <li> Winter fashoin was class apart </li>
    <li> Christmas Eve at Connaught place looked like as if it was a European Country </li>
    <li> Impromptu music bands on the streets of CP </li>
    <li> Frequent strikes by civic society </li>
    <li> I was already in admiration of the civic movement which elected AAP to power. But to see them fight elecion when I was in the city was too good. </li>
    <li> I visited Mathura and Vrindavan over the weekend just before holi. </li>
  </ul>
