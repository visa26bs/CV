  <h1> Away from Home, Part 1, Ariyalur </h1>

     <li>I have lived away from home for two years of my life. And that has taught me the most in life. I would give anything, to be able to live by myself, again. But unfortunately no. </li>
     <li>Ariyalur district is 4 hours drive from the capital city of Tamil Nadu. The district is known to harbour naxalites. But frankly, I had never heard of naxal attacks in Tamil Nadu. But to my surprise, the second day since I went there, the head of a local group passed away due to illness and the whole district had shut down. Unfortunately for me, my phone had a minor issue and I had given it for repair the day before. </li>
     <li>Stuck in a new town with no phone and experiencing curfew for the first time in life, I was scared, bored and irritated. </li>
     <li>The bigger issue was that the hotels were closed and I could'nt find food for myself. I went out in search of hotel and I saw the locals banging on shutters of shops that were open, forcing every shop in the vicinity to close.</li>
     <li>Finding a house in the 'Developed areas' of the district with bathroom inside the house was a different ballgame altogether. My colleagues were kind enough to come alongwith me and suggest the right locations where I may find a house to my liking. </li>
     <li> <B> Parody </B> I was told that the main source of livelihood for the residents of Ariyalur district is employment with Cement factories. The district has a bed of lime stone due to which there are many Cement factories operating from the district. This means the rain water doesnt get stored in the water table and is lost mostly as surface run off, so I was told. This means the district experiences water scarcity in the summer months.</li>
     <li>You wouldnt beleive if I said this. I went to Ariyalur towards mid of summer and to my utter disbelief, it rained <strong>EVERY SINGLE EVENING </strong> for three weeks straight. Towards the end of that spell, there was a rumour that if the spell extends any longer one could expect floods in the district. All these really caught me offguard. My family was already grieving the death of a family member and this was too many changes, uncertaininty and too soon for us/Me.</li>
     <li>I will be lying if I said I did not ask for a change of district. But, I told to myself if I survive the first 15 days, I will be able to complete this fellowship. And thats what I did! </li>
</ol><br />
     <h4> Long story short: I will summarise in the below points: </h4>
<ul><br />
     <li>Majority of my colleagues had worked in Capital city for a brief stint and they have settled back in district since after marriage their life partner did not want to move to the city. They explained to me how the household economics works out in their favour, by settling in Ariyalur. </li>
     <li>I have always wanted to live in the countryside to know the lifestyle. I find their household economics very interesting. Courtesy POOR ECONOMICS book. But even before I went to the district I was told there is almost little to no agriculture in this district because the land pattern doesnt have favourable conditions. But what was a pleasant surprise to me was, the neighbouring districts were the food bowl of the state and hardly 40 mins drive from my home and I saw the lush green fields, peacocks, trucks with loads of agriculture produce. I even got to see the hugely profitable cashew farms. </li>
     <li>In my mind, I thought the lower cadre staffs would be from the poorer sections of the society. But some of these staffs were from the family of cashew farmers (i.e Rich households) </li>
     <li>These staffs helped me find a house, helped me settle in my house, they showed love to my Mom who also lived with me in a rented house. </li>
     <li>I saw first hand the power structures in the society i.e Politicians, Caste based, Government employees. </li>
     <li>I was happy to see how festivals, public life and Government activities seemlessly blended. For example, Some of the festivals were declared as a local holiday. There were Grama Sabha meetings on Independence day, Republic day and after the meeting the officials would have their meals at the main temple of the district. </li>
     <li>I saw how some of the public goods were well built and maintained by the people and relevant officials the same. </li>
     <li>There is a beautiful Bird sanctuary in the district which is nit yet fully developed. I visited this unexplored destination during a sunset. The district is known for Discovery of many a dinosaur eggs. There are some centuries old. historically significant temples, forts and other heritage sites. I loved the huge lake with a well built walking path. When visited in the evening, the trees are filled with birds chirping. The district has market once a week (Sunday). People get all kinds of food supplies for the entire week on this day. Other days of the week there are less vegetables available to buy. </li>
    <li>First time in my life, I had the experience of living without a fridge and T.V and living amidst vareities of birds, lizards, snakes and monkeys.</li>
    <li>Since vegetables were majorly available only on Sundays, I had to buy the fridge. As for entertainment, Me and mom started using mobile phones for a lot more time. </li>
     <li>What added to the misery during Sweltering summers was power cuts in the nights. I used to literally look forward to visiting my home at Chennai in the weekend just to sleep peacefully. Chennai used to feel chill without the Airconditioner during summer, So you can Imagine. Celebrating religious festivals, New Years with the locals is memorable and my neighbours are still in touch </li>
     <li>I used to eat food from my lunch box using a spoon. People here brought their food in a tiffin carrier but ate it from a plate using their hands. They used to look at me like I am a culture ridden girl from the city </li>
     <li>People around me figured out my caste from the language I spoke. I dint know their caste unless they spoke about it openly. And some of them did. </li>
  </ul>
